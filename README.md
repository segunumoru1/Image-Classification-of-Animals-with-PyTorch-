# Image Classification with PyTorch using Atlantis Dataset

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and methodology for performing image classification using PyTorch with the Atlantis dataset. The Atlantis dataset consists of a diverse set of images and is commonly used for benchmarking image classification algorithms.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is preprocessed to resize, normalize, and augment the images to improve model generalization.
2. **Model Selection**: A suitable pre-trained model (e.g., ResNet, VGG, Inception) is chosen as the base architecture for transfer learning.
3. **Fine-tuning**: The pre-trained model is fine-tuned on the Atlantis dataset to adapt it to the specific classification task.
4. **Training**: The model is trained using the preprocessed dataset and an appropriate loss function and optimizer.
5. **Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated on a separate validation set to assess its performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Libraries
The following Python libraries are used in this project:
- **PyTorch**: A popular deep learning framework for building and training neural networks.
- **torchvision**: Provides datasets, models, and transformations for computer vision tasks in PyTorch.
- **Pillow**: A Python Imaging Library (PIL) that adds image processing capabilities to your Python interpreter.
- **NumPy**: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python, used for array operations and data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension, NumPy.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/atlantis-image-classification.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Download the Atlantis dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.
4. Run the training script: `python train.py`
5. Evaluate the trained model: `python evaluate.py`

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of building an image classification model using PyTorch with the Atlantis dataset. By following the methodology and utilizing the mentioned libraries, users can create and train their own image classification models for various applications.
